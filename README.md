# Karolina Kulpinska - Personal Portfolio

## Description

This week my job was to design and code my personal portfolio website so that it meets typical hiring manager's needs:
* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me;
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section;
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications;
* When presented with my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others;
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application;
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

I've also made sure that the application:
* loads with no errors;
* resembles the mockup functionality as close as possible;
* follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions as well as class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
